# Caesar-Cipher
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

Here's an example of how the Caesar cipher works:

Original text: "Hello, world!"<br>
Shift count: 3 <br>
Encrypted text: "Khoor, zruog!"<br>

**About the code**: <br>
The **caesar_cipher.py** script contains a Python function caesar_cipher(text, shift) that encrypts text using the Caesar cipher algorithm. It takes two parameters:

text: The plaintext to be encrypted.
shift: The number of positions to shift each letter in the alphabet.
